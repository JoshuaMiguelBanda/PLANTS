				<h4>ABOUT PLANTS</h4>
				<p>Plants include familiar types such as trees, herbs, bushes, grasses, vines, ferns, mosses, and green algae.
				 The scientific study of plants, known as botany, has identified about 350,000 extant species of plants. 
				 Fungi and non-green algae are not classified as plants.</p>

				 <p>Most plants grow in the ground, with stems in the air and roots below the surface. Some float on water. The root part absorbs
				 water and some nutrients the plant needs to live and grow. These climb the stem and reach the leaves. The evaporation of water from
				 pores in the leaves pulls water through the plant. This is called transpiration.</p>

				<p>A plant needs sunlight, carbon dioxide, minerals and water to make food by photosynthesis. A green substance in plants called chlorophyll
				 traps the energy from the Sun needed to make food. Chlorophyll is mostly found in leaves, inside plastids, which are inside the leaf cells.
				  The leaf can be thought of as a food factory. Leaves of plants vary in shape and size, but they are always the plant organ best suited to
				   capture solar energy. Once the food is made in the leaf, it is transported to the other parts of the plant such as stems and roots.</p>
